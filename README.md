# HOMEWORK 3

Keep the test/input files, blosum file in the same directory as code(main.cpp).

In all the parts, I have used the command line argument for taking the sample file as input.  <br />

Keep the blosum filename as "BLOSUM62.txt". <br />

To run the code, use following commands in shell. <br />
g++ main.cpp  <br />
./a.out sample_input_filename  <br />

For instance to create the output file for sample_1 input file use following commands:  <br />
g++ main.cpp  <br />
./a.out test_1  <br />

If the input file is from debugging(input_1,input_2..) folder, the output files will be named as output_1,output_2... <br />
If the input file is from submission(test_1) folder, the output files will be named as out_1 <br />

For your convenience, apart form submitting in zip I am also attaching replit link so that you can directly run from this environment. <br />
